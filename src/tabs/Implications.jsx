        The results of the current study bridge the findings from both research on the effect of colour on emotion and research investigating the effects of art on psychology. It highlights that viewing art can result in both pleasant or unpleasant feelings, depending on the artworkâ€™s characteristics, like in the current example - colour. It shows a clear link between brightness and valence, and saturation and arousal. However, contradicting older research (Adams & Osgood, 1973; Wilson, 1966) and more in line with the current one (Dael et al., 2016, Wilms & Oberfeld, 2017), it shows that the influence of hue is not straight-forward. The current study found a clear association only for yellow-positivity, but the other hues were dependent on other colour dimensions (Valdez & Mehrabian, 1994).

        What is new, our study offers a set of exemplar paintings which can be used for reference for future research on influence of colour on emotion, and when designing an art intervention with the use of colour and real art. After reviewing the past literature on art in psychology, it was found that often studies just expose participants to art without paying enough attention to characteristics of the art used, as in Tyack et al. (2017). However, as Savazzi et al.(2020) highlight, identifying specific colour used in the painting is a key to a successful intervention. The current study supports this idea, and gives examples for the future use.
