        The study also had some limitations that could be addressed in future research. Although all efforts were made to control for colour dimensions, levels of Saturation and Brightness could vary across different Hues 
        because the study used real paintings, without manipulating their colour. In future research, it would be great to conduct the study with paintings created for the needs of a study - to fully control for the dimensions 
        of colour but still investigate the influence of the real art. That could also solve another limitation of the study, which is measuring the effect of a limited amount of hues. As researchers criticise, many of the known 
        studies used only limited and arbitrarily chosen colour stimuli (Zielinski, 2016). This constraint in the current study is due to restrained availability of paintings presenting the same object or scene.

        Although Impressionism 
        gives many series of paintings, created by for example Paul Cézanne, Edgar Degas and Gustave Caillebotte, it can be a challenge to identify suitable paintings varying in colour dimensions. Perhaps works from some other art movement, 
        like pop art could be used, because the inherent characteristic of this style is repetition, which could ease the colour manipulation. Paintings of different subjects could be used, as long as the researchers control for other painting 
        elements that could influence participants’ emotions and in result bias the outcome of the study (Kim, 2010).
        Moreover, as suggested in Drake, Eizayaga & Wawrzynski (2023) not only can art induce emotions but our emotions can also influence the process of perceiving art. The research could then put participants in the state of joy, sadness or neutral 
        (for example by showing certain video), and then investigate whether the effect of art on emotion would still be significant and how strong it would be.

        It would be also good to address some general limitations of the study. Firstly, the current study recruited a homogenous sample (mostly UK female students completing the study). Future studies should try recruiting participants with more diverse characteristics to be able to obtain more generalisable findings (Linden, Pollet & Hönekopp, 2024). Secondly, future research could include some more levels of colour dimensions, for example as in Wilms & Oberfeld (2017), who included not only high and low, but also medium levels of saturation and brightness. Finally, the study had a form of an online questionnaire. The results obtained are still a valuable source of information and can be a starting point of more elaborated research. However, as previous studies suggest, viewing art in-person in a museum setting can have an even more profound effect on people’s emotions, by providing a more conducive environment for engagement with art (Cotter et al., 2022).
