        The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of colour dimensions: hue, saturation, and brightness, on emotion dimensions: valence and arousal, by the use of visual art. There were 12 impressionist paintings used, all presenting the same object - Rouen cathedral but varying in colour dimensions. In line with the recent research findings, the study aimed to approach the study of colour not as a unitary mode but dimensionally, strongly differentiating between hue, saturation and brightness and how they influence emotion dimensions.
        Moreover, the study aimed to highlight the importance of art, exploring whether art itself and its certain elements are capable of eliciting significant emotional reactions.

        The overall conclusion is that the effect of each colour dimension is subtle, and even though each can significantly influence certain emotion, only by analysing them all together can we get a full picture of how colour influences emotion. However, knowing that specific colour dimensions can influence specific emotion dimensions can be useful in designing new studies, planning interventions and overall, enhancing public health.
What is important, is that as planned, the study shows significant findings supporting the notion that art itself can influence human psychology. It contributes to the existing literature on colour with the different methods used. As the past research was mostly using colour patches or colour terms, the current study may shed a new light on how to incorporate art in the study of colour and explains the benefits of using art in psychology.
The current study confirms that art can be used as a medium of eliciting emotional responses, and depending on its specific characteristic like colour, is capable of placing participants in a certain mood.
